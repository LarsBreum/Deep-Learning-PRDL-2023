# PRDL Deep Learning Report, UPM 2023
This is the problem definition and planned activities for my examination project regarding Deep Learning during the course "Predictive and Descriptive Learning"2023.


# The Report
## Part 1: General Theory
I plan to go through the theory describing the basics of Deep Learning (DL) and the following technologies: Feed Forward, CNN and RNN, Attention and Transformers.
As well as Data Augmentation, Transfer Learning, Fine-Tuning and Generative Models.

## Part 2: Practice: Designing a (simple) Spam Filter based on Deep Learning
The goal is to implement a simple E-mail spam filter using DL technology, as well as exploring the theoretical aspects of such an approach. Some questions I want to answer are:
1. Is a DL spam filter feasible?
2. What trade-offs exists within different DL mehods?
3. How does my DL model compare to current spam filters? ML or DL based. 

I might do more practical exercises based on the notebooks provided, if time allows or I feel like it will help me engage with the material. 
But my initial idea is to only do this to show the implication of some theory, if I deem it necesarry.

### Part 2.1: Specific Theory
I will explain additional theory that is relevant for language (spam) processing

### Part 2.2: Implementation, Abalation and Iterative Tuning
I will use this blog as a jumpo off point for implementing a the Spam filter:

I will experiment with Abaltion studies of the network.

### Part 2.3: Results, Comparisons and Conclusions
